Angular-Validation change logs

1.1.0: only start validating after user inactivity, it could also be passed as an argument for more customization of the inactivity timeout (typing-limit).
1.3.0: support to Angular 1.3.x
1.3.1: Added Input Match (confirmation) Validator
1.3.2: Float number validator to also permit dot (.) as first char. Also removed keyboard blocking of invalid character on input type="number" instead display error message.
1.3.3: Updated Bootstrap(3.3.1) and AngularJS(1.3.7) to latest versions
1.3.4: Removed the necessity of creating a <span> for displaying the error message, the directive now handles it by itself.
1.3.5: Throw an error message when user did not provide a name="" property inside the element to validate.
1.3.6: Added ng-strict-di for minification, renamed some files and folder lib to /vendors, moved directive into new /src folder for better separation.
1.3.7: Complete rewrite (but same functionality) so that I could add an Angular-Validation Service which is similar implementation as the Directive. Also added `debounce` attribute which is an alias to `typingLimit`, validation rules are now defined as an external service for better maintainability and also created a common file for shared functions by both Validation Directive and Service.
